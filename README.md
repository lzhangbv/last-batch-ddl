# last-batch-ddl: Benchmarks for Distributed Deep Learning with Last-batch Optimizations. 

## Introduction
This repository implements last-batch optimizations to accelerate distributed deep learning training 
by fully pipelining the feed-forward and back-propagation computations with the last-batch gradient communications.
